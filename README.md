Domain Finder
=============

Domain Finder searches for domain availability. It works with Ajax and shows the search results "in place" - users don't need to move to a dedicated page for the domain search process. TLDs (domain extensions like .com or .net) are fully customizable. Domain finder also features a "More info" button that shows more information about a taken domain gathered from the WHOIS server.

Results in place is a feature intentionally made so that users don't leave the page. This way webmasters can keep the good conversion rate of the page that features Domain Finder.

The supported TLDs are the ones suported by WHOIS servers.

This extension is MVC compatible. Those with enough experience with the PHP computing language can write their own layout mechanism (viewer).
